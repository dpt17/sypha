# sypha
Collection of utility code and tools in various programming languages built for varied purposes (i.e. not a focused application).

git clone https://github.com/dpt17/sypha

# libsyphac - C

$ cd syphac

$ make

$ make install

OR

$ sudo make install

Add /usr/local/sypha/include to your include path and /usr/local/sypha/lib to your library path

# libsyphacpp - C++

Note: libsyphacpp depends on libsyphac and the latter should be built first

$ cd syphacpp

$ make

$ make install

OR

$ sudo make install

Add /usr/local/sypha/include to your include path and /usr/local/sypha/lib to your library path

# syphapy - Python

$ cd syphapy

$ poetry build

Then add dependencies locally (see https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add).  Will look to add a fancier install approach later.

# tools

A collection of scripts and/or tiny apps that don't merit their own focused repo



Note: other languages will be added in due course
